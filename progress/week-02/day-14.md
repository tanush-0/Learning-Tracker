# 📅 Day 14 – 4 August 2025

## ✅ What I Did

- 🛡️ Researched and implemented a new Cybersecurity Journal Entry on **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**
- 🔖 Added rich content including:
  - Real-world example of how an attacker might inject a script
  - Security fix recommendations
  - Trusted learning resources from MDN and OWASP
- 👨‍💻 Reviewed and cleaned up `index.html`, `style.css`, and `main.js`
  - Confirmed accessibility attributes (ARIA) are properly used
  - Verified responsive design and modular layout are clean
  - Buttons and toggle interactions are JavaScript modular
- 🎯 Assessed overall interface and learning structure

## 🧠 Notes

- XSS is a major threat to client-side security and often exploited via unsanitized input
- Proper use of `hidden`, `aria-expanded`, and modular functions improves UX and accessibility
- Modular JS and a scalable card-based layout help build maintainable interfaces

## 🧭 Coming Up: Day 15+

- 🔍 Add filtering or search in Cybersecurity Journal or Projects section
- 🔁 Build reusable UI components with JavaScript (e.g., generate journal cards from data)
- 🗃️ Store and load entries using JSON (client-side dynamic rendering)
- 🎞️ Animate elements on scroll using IntersectionObserver or lightweight libraries
- 💾 Save dark/light mode preference in localStorage

## 📌 Goal

Transition from static to dynamic, data-driven, and reactive web design — while practicing key frontend security and UX design principles.
