# 📅 Day 12 – 2 August 2025

## ✅ What I Did

- Added a new **Cybersecurity Journal** section with a styled entry for *Benign-looking Malware*
- Created a **Physics Recap** block reviewing key formulas from Uniform Circular Motion (UCM)
- Made journal and recap sections **reusable** using a shared `.entry-card` class
- Introduced **badges/tags** for categorizing topics (e.g., `⚠️ Medium Risk`, `🧠 Theory`, `📦 Real-World`)
- Added **jump links** to navbar to quickly navigate to `#projects`, `#cyber-journal`, and `#physics-recap`
- Implemented **collapsible “Read More”** toggles inside each journal/recap entry
- Included **external learning resources** with links to MDN, GeeksforGeeks, etc., under each entry

## 🧠 Notes

- Reusability via CSS classes helps avoid redundancy and keep layout consistent
- Badges improve visual hierarchy and filterability
- Internal jump links (`<a href="#id">`) enhance UX and navigation
- Collapsible content improves readability and progressive disclosure of information
- Linking external references supports long-term revision and deeper learning

## 🚀 To Do Tomorrow

- Begin learning **how to use modals** for displaying detailed information
- Explore **differences between modals and tabs** in UX and interactivity
- Ensure accessibility for modals (focus traps, ARIA, keyboard nav)
