# 📅 Day 11 – 1 August 2025

## ✅ What I Did
- 🕵️‍♂️ Researched **benign-looking malware**:
  - Explored how seemingly harmless software can carry malicious payloads
  - Studied real-world examples like clipboard hijackers and fileless malware
- 📘 Physics: Reviewed **Uniform Circular Motion (UCM)**:
  - Focused on centripetal force, angular velocity, and acceleration equations
  - Understood relationships between linear and rotational motion

## 🧠 What I Learned

### 🔹 Cybersecurity Concepts
- **Benign-looking malware** hides malicious intent behind user-friendly interfaces
- Malware often disguises itself as:
  - PDF readers
  - Browser extensions
  - Fake system tools
- Learned importance of:
  - Code review and static analysis
  - Behavior-based detection (sandboxing, monitoring runtime behavior)
  - Trusting software sources

### 🔹 Uniform Circular Motion
- **Key Formulas Reviewed**:
  - \( a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} \) (centripetal acceleration)
  - \( F_c = m \cdot \frac{v^2}{r} \)
  - \( v = r \cdot \omega \) (tangential velocity)
- Clarified units and direction of forces in circular paths

## 🚀 To Do Tomorrow (Day 12)
- Add a new tab or section in your About Me project for “Cybersecurity Journal”
- Summarize malware types with icons or badges
- Continue revision of Mechanics + practice problems
