# ðŸ“… Day 10 â€“ 31 July 2025

## âœ… What I Did
- Added a new **Projects** section to my About Me site
- Designed project cards using **CSS Flexbox**
- Created three placeholder projects:
  - âœ… About Me Page
  - ðŸ”¨ Cybersecurity Challenges (In Progress)
  - ðŸš§ Portfolio Website (Planned)
- Used consistent button styling (`Live Demo`, `View Code`)
- Ensured **mobile responsiveness** using media queries
- Maintained accessibility by:
  - Adding proper `<section aria-label="">`
  - Using semantic headings (`<h2>`, `<h3>`)
- Committed changes using Git with clean message

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

### ðŸ”¹ Project Section Structure
- How to represent individual projects in cards
- Designing scalable layouts that can grow with new projects

### ðŸ”¹ Flexbox for Layouts
- Used `flex-wrap`, `gap`, and `justify-content` to make responsive card grid
- Controlled width and responsiveness with `flex: 1 1 280px;`

### ðŸ”¹ Status Labels
- Used `span.project-status` to visually indicate project progress

### ðŸ”¹ CSS Best Practices
- Added new styles at the bottom of `style.css` to keep things organized
- Reused CSS variables (`--card-bg`, `--button-bg`, etc.) for consistency

## ðŸš€ To Do Tomorrow (Day 11)
- Add basic interactivity (e.g., hover animation, show/hide project details)
- Optional: Add icons, tags, or GitHub repo stats with JS
- Start preparing to extract projects into modular components (for reuse)
