# 📅 Day 13 – 3 August 2025

## ✅ What I Did

- Created a separate Git branch for safe edits (`day-13-enhancements`)
- Added a new **Cybersecurity Journal Entry** on Fileless Malware:
  - Described how memory-resident malware avoids disk detection
  - Tagged with badges like `⚠️ Stealth Attack` and `🧠 Memory-based`
  - Included learning resources from CrowdStrike and TechTarget
- Appended a new **Git Learning Resources** section:
  - Added curated links (Atlassian, Visual Git Branching, GitHub Guides)
- Practiced proper Git workflow:
  - Created feature branch
  - Made edits and committed with descriptive message
  - Merged back into `main` and deleted feature branch

## 🧠 Notes

- Fileless malware is hard to detect and becoming more common in targeted attacks
- Reusing UI components like `.entry-card` and `.badge` speeds up development
- Git branches help isolate work without affecting the main project
- Clear commit messages improve long-term version control

## 🚀 To Do Tomorrow

- Start learning how to **secure web projects (client-side)** from XSS, CSRF, etc.
- Add a modal-based journal reader for better UX (optional)
