# ðŸ“… Day 5 â€“ 26 July 2025

## âœ… What I Did
- Designed and styled the **Dark Mode** and **More Info** buttons to match card layout
- Added a **Skills section** using Flexbox for layout and clarity
- Started building a **JavaScript-powered contact form** with basic validation
- Practiced encrypting and decrypting files using `gpg` in the Linux terminal

## ðŸ§  Notes
- Used `transition`, `border-radius`, `box-shadow`, and `hover` for smooth UI
- Flexbox allows easy horizontal layout with `display: flex; gap: 10px;`
- JavaScript validation helps check empty fields before submitting
- `gpg -c filename.txt` encrypts a file with symmetric encryption (asks for passphrase)

## ðŸš€ To Do Tomorrow
- Finalize contact form with better UI + improved JS
- Add favicon, SEO metadata, and polish layout
- Learn about hashing (SHA256, MD5) and verify integrity using `sha256sum`
