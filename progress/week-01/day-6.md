# ðŸ“… Day 6 â€“ 27 July 2025

## âœ… What I Did
- Introduced CSS custom properties for colors and layout
- Refactored all hard-coded styles into reusable variables
- Added active state to navbar links
- Implemented semantic elements and ARIA roles
- Enhanced responsive styling for mobile
- Improved dark mode hover/focus styling for buttons

## ðŸ§  Notes
- `:root` is a powerful place to define global CSS variables
- Variables reduce duplication and improve maintainability
- ARIA roles improve accessibility, especially for screen readers
- Semantic elements like `<main>` and `<footer>` give structure to HTML

## ðŸš€ To Do Tomorrow
- Begin "Contact Me" form using HTML5 inputs and form validation
- Add form responsiveness and basic interactivity with JavaScript
- Start prepping About-Me for GitHub Pages deployment
