#ðŸ“… Day 2 â€“ 23 July 2025

##âœ… What I Did
-Added external CSS (style.css) to the existing about-me project
-Styled headings, paragraphs, links, and body layout
-Practiced basic Linux terminal commands within the project directory
-Used mv, cp, mkdir, cat, echo, and diff effectively
-Created a backup folder and manipulated project files using CLI

##ðŸ§  Notes
-Use <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"> to attach external CSS
-CSS selectors: element (p), class (.highlight), ID (#main-heading)
-Linux CLI lets you version, backup, and control everything faster than GUI
-diff file1 file2 is helpful for seeing content differences

##ðŸš€ To Do Tomorrow
-Deep dive into CSS layout: position, flexbox, display
-Deploy the about-me site using GitHub Pages
-Learn the basics of version control: clone, branch, merge
