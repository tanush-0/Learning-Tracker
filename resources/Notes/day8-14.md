# 📘 Notes & Learnings — About Me Project (Day 8 to Day 14)

---

## 🔹 Codebase Cleanup & Review (Day 8–9)

- Removed tabbed/modal bloat for a cleaner UI
- Revisited:
  - Folder structure, HTML semantics, accessibility
  - JS modularity and scoped listeners
- Ensured clarity of purpose: Focused learning-through-building
- Key decision: Stick to clean buttons + toggle interface for core features

---

## 🔹 Project Section Design (Day 10)

- Introduced a new `#projects` section:
  - Semantic card layout with `div.card.project-card`
  - Added `.badge` tags for stack: HTML, CSS, JS, etc.
- Used responsive flexbox with media queries for layout:
  ```css
  .projects-grid {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    gap: 20px;
  }
- Maintained theme and accessibility support (dark mode, keyboard focus)

---

## 🔹 Knowledge Integration (Day 11)

- ✍️ Cybersecurity: Researched benign-looking malware
- 📘 Physics: Logged notes on Uniform Circular Motion
- Journal entries added with `entry-card`, `badge`, and collapsible `<details>`

---

##🔹 Layout Reusability & Features (Day 12)

- Introduced reusable `.entry-card` and `.project-card` patterns
- Created `details` block under each entry using:
  ```html
  <details><summary>Read more</summary>...</details>
- Added tag filtering groundwork using `data-tags` attributes:
  ```html
  <div class="entry-card" data-tags="cyber,js">
- Appended revision links using:
  ```html
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/" target="_blank">MDN Reference</a>

---

## 🔹 Git Workflows + Malware Study (Day 13)

- Cyber Journal: Explored Fileless Malware
- Git: Learned proper branching strategy:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/entry-xss
  git merge --no-ff
  git rebase main
- Practiced semantically clear commit messages:
  - "🔐 Add XSS entry with script example"
  - "♻️ Refactor entry-card into reusable layout"

---

## 🔹 Client-Side Security & UX Review (Day 14)

- Deep-dived into XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) types and fixes:
  - Reflected (URL-based), Stored (DB/DOM), DOM-based (client-side only)
- Prevention learned:
  - Input sanitization + Output encoding
  - Avoid direct .innerHTML unless sanitized
- JS Safety Tip:
  ```js
  textElement.textContent = userInput;
- Confirmed overall UX integrity:
  - Smooth theme transitions
  -  Dark mode consistency
  - Buttons accessible and ARIA-compliant
